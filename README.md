# Needles in a haystack 

> (Ethan Schauder)



Unfortunately, the spectral seamstress has lost her special needle, ```“golden/\needle”``` in an endless pile of  ```“hay”```, ```“chaff”```, and```“straw”```! To make matters worse, the wicked warthog, a mortal enemy of the special seamstress, has scattered several decoy “golden/\needle” throughout the haystack.

     

Luckily, the real “golden/\needle” can be differentiated from the decoys due to the fact it changes the otherwise randomly assorted “hay”, “chaff”, and“straw” around it into a recognizable pattern. The pattern extends for ***100 items on either side of the “golden/\needle”.***


Find the “golden/\needle” in the .txt file attached to help out the spectral seamstress and complete the challenge! (Submissions must be sent via email to **<ins>ETHAN SCHAUDER</ins>** and should include the line number of the special “golden/\needle”  as well as a screenshot of your code) 



Objective: The “golden/\needle” is hidden in the text document “haystack.txt”. Try to find it using the information above. Please contact one of the CSC officers if you have any questions.
